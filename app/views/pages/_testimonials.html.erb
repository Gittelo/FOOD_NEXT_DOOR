                Food Next Door enables busy people to earn extra money by doing something I love  - cooking! The team is great and all the details about posting the meal on the platform were taken care by them, so cooks only have to cook!

                I always dreamed of earning money with my cooking skills, although I was never able to work on this field. Food Next Door allows me to provide great home made meals to my neighbourhood. So far it has been a great experience, as I did not know I lived near so many nice people!

                Starting a side business has always been part of my projects, although I always had difficulty in finding potential clients. Food Next Door enables me to cook my meals and the clients arrive at the door to get them. Wonderful!

                I never knew I would be able to start my own business, as I don't have any business background and marketing skills. The team welcomed me very well, and after the  approval of my meals I now have an extra income!

                I tried to cook for my neighboors last year, but things got very messy, as there were no platform and I was always on the phone to get clients! Food Next Door's platform is amazing, easy and very user friendly.

                I worked at a Restaurant before, so I have some experience in cooking. But this is so different, in the sense that you are improving the well-being of your neighbours and the community. I feel I am making a difference. Thanks Food Next Door!
